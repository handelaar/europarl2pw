Work in progress to convert European Parliament plenary transcripts to publicwhip xml

If you find this before it's finished:  it's not finished.  Currently (2022-12-15) it's successfully converting one source file into one xml output.

A *great deal* more is to follow.

## Why?

Because it needs doing and nobody else has done so (possibly no one other person *can*, I dunno).

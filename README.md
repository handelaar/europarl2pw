Work in progress to convert European Parliament plenary transcripts to publicwhip xml

If you find this before it's finished:  it's not finished.  Currently (2022-12-15) it's successfully converting one source file into one xml output.

A *great deal* more is to follow.

## Why?

Because it needs doing and nobody else has done so (possibly no one other person *can*, I dunno).

Have you *tried* to find out what is going on at the European Parliament?  The transcripts don't get translated for **three to four months**. 
So if you don't speak 23 languages you're basically SOL. Additionally, none of the written questions and answers, nor anything about votes which occur,
are held anywhere near the transcripts which they ought to be part of.

That is **by design**. It needs to stop.
